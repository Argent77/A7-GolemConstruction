~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
============

Golems can be constructed with the "Construct Golem" ability which you can learn from the various golem building manuals.
A short dialog allows you to select the desired golem type and variant to build. The construction of the physical 
body takes several hours up to several days, followed by the enchantment process. There is a 4 percent chance that 
the golem may break free and turn on the caster for 1d4 rounds before it finally submits to your will. After the 
construction process finished the caster will be too tired to cast spells or fight properly for several rounds.

Because of the equipment required to successfully construct the golem's body you are limited to a few selected locations 
where you can actually build a golem. Promising locations are usually (abandoned) strongholds of powerful mages.
More details can be found at the end of this document.

The "Construct Golem" ability can be used as many times as needed without the need to rest in between (although it is 
strongly recommended).

Golem manuals will also teach you the "Repair Golem" ability. It can be used once per day in any location, but does 
not work while enemies are around. The repair process takes about two rounds. Heavily damaged golems may require several 
attempts to restore them to full health.


Conventional Golems
===================

Conventional golem types are described in the "Manual of Golem Building" which comes in five volumes. The tomes 
themselves are not terribly difficult to obtain. Some can be purchased from merchants while others may be hidden 
in some dungeon or guarded by creatures.

The materials required to build golems are also obtainable from various sources. More common ingredients can be bought 
from merchants, looted from creatures or found in various locations, while the more expensive or exotic materials are 
available by other means.

Conventional golem types can be build in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants. Each variant requires its own 
materials. The perfect variant will also require a specific artifact of power which is only available in limited numbers.

Exotic Golems
=============

Exotic golem types are described in the "Secret Manual of Golem Building" which is supposed to come in three volumes.

Golems described in these tomes are unique, and therefore not available as lesser, greater or perfect variants.

1. Bone Golem
- Min. level: 12 (-2 for Necromancers and Transmuters, +2 for Bards)
- Ingredients:
  - Four piles of bones
  - One scroll of Animate Dead
  - 50% chance that the construction process drains three points of strength or constitution for five turns from the 
    caster, possibly killing the caster if fully drained.
- Stats:
  - STR: 16
  - HP: 56
  - AC: -1
  - THAC0: 7
  - APR: 2
  - Saves: 9/12/10/9/13
- Resistances:
  - Magic: 50
  - Fire: 25
  - Magic Fire: 25
  - Cold: 100
  - Magic Cold: 100
  - Slashing: 50
  - Piercing: 50
  - Missile: 50
- May cast "Hideous Laughter" which affects enemies within 30 ft. range: Victims that fail their save vs. spell will 
  run around in fear for 2d6 rounds. If they also fail their save vs. death, they will by paralyzed with fear instead.

2. Ice Golem
- Min. level: 14 (-2 for Transmuters, +3 for Bards)
- Ingredients:
  - One shard of magical ice
  - One scroll of Cone of Cold
  - One scroll of Protection from Cold
- Stats:
  - STR: 18
  - HP: 75
  - AC: -2
  - THAC0: 4
  - APR: 3/2
  - Saves: 6/9/8/8/10
- Resistances:
  - Magic: 75
  - Fire: -25
  - Magic Fire: -25
  - Cold: 100
  - Magic Cold: 100
  - Slashing: 20
  - Piercing: 20
  - Missile: 40
- Immune to non-magical weapons
- May cast Scalding Steam which does 3d10 area of effect cold damage (save vs. breath to avoid)

3. Lightning Golem
- Min. level: 17 (-2 for Transmuters, +5 for Bards)
- Ingredients:
  - 100,000 gold
  - One scroll of Chain Lightning
- Stats:
  - STR: 19
  - HP: 80
  - AC: -4
  - THAC0: 5
  - APR: 3
  - Saves: 6/8/7/7/9
- Resistance:
  - Magic: 100
  - Cold: 85
  - Magic Cold: 85
  - Electricity: 125
  - Acid: 50
  - Slashing: 25
  - Piercing: 50
  - Missile: 50
- Immune to non-magical and +1 weapons
- Moves at increased speed
- Permanent lightning shield: Attackers suffer 1d8+2 electrical damage on each successful hit
- May cast Chain Lightning on nearby enemies
- May cast "Lightning Travel" which allows the golem to travel to any point within visual range by transforming into 
  a powerful bolt of lightning and travelling to the target at light speed. The high speed transportation generates 
  a shockwave that will blow away and cause 1d6 lightning damage to all creatures within 8 feet radius of the target 
  location. The resulting thunderclap may also cause deafness to any creature in range for 1d4 rounds if they fail 
  their Saving Throw vs. Breath. The golem also does not have to wait for its aura to be cleansed before using the 
  same or another ability again. This ability replaces "Teleport".


Each golem has the following abilities by default:
1. Dismiss:  Activating this ability will cause the golem to disintegrate. The process is irreversible.
2. Teleport: Teleports itself to a selected party member in visual range. This ability may be needed for golems with 
             big circle sizes so they won't get stuck in narrow pathways. It can only be used while no enemies are 
             around.
             Note: This ability is added by the Tweaks component "Add "Teleport" ability to golems".

You can also give your golems simple commands. Lesser variants of flesh, clay and stone golems may follow the following 
orders:
- Follow me! (The golem becomes controllable, but does not act on its own. This is the default action after activation.)
- Stand guard! (The golem turns neutral and does not budge from its current position.)
- Destroy yourself! (Causes the golem to disintegrate. This command is the same as the "Dismiss" ability, but can also 
                     be issued when the golem is on guard duty.)

More advanced golems may also follow the following orders:
- Follow and protect me! (The golem becomes controllable and will attack any hostile creature in sight, or enemies that 
                          are attacking party members.)
- Stand guard and defend the area! (The golem turns neutral and attacks any hostile creature in sight. Always returns 
                                    to its guarded position.)

You should always take good care of your golems as they may start to malfunction when badly damaged. These penalties can 
be removed by the "Repair Golem" ability.


Spells that are affecting golems in some way
============================================

Since golems are non-living constructs they may be affected differently by certain spells. The following effects can 
be triggered when the Tweaks component "Make golems vulnerable to specific spell effects" has been installed:
- Flesh to Stone:
  Turns Flesh Golems into Stone Golems of the same variant if they fail their Saving Throw vs. Petrify/Polymorph.
- Stone to Flesh:
  Turns Stone Golems into Flesh Golems of the same variant if they fail their Saving Throw vs. Petrify/Polymorph.
- Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting:
  This spell dehydrates all Clay Golems in the area of effect and turns them into Stone Golems if they fail their 
  Saving Throw vs. Spell at -2 penalty.
- Cone of Cold and Ice Storm:
  Clay Golems hit by this spell are slowed for five rounds if they fail their Saving Throw vs. Spell.
- High-level fire-based spells:
  These spells will heat up Iron Golems for five rounds (no save). In this time they are able to deal out fire damage 
  in addition to physical damage.
  The following spells are know to cause this effect: Meteor Swarm, Dragon's Breath, Comet, Incendiary Cloud, Fire 
  Storm and Heavenly Inferno.


Known locations where you can successfully construct golems
===========================================================

- Dragon's Eye Level 3, Laboratory:
  You may be able to use the laboratory after taking care of Presio and his undead minions.

- Severed Hand, Larrel's Study:
  The caretaker Gelarith may allow you to build golems in this place if you helped him fixing the AstroLab.

- Dorn's Deep, Bandoth's Laboratory:
  You can bribe, threaten or kill Bandoth if you want to use his laboratory as another location for building golems.

- Lower Dorn's Deep, Home of the drow wizard Malavon:
  This place can be used to construct golems after taking care of Malavon and his minions.

- Gloomfrost, Tiernon's Forge:
  Tiernon might allow you to use his forge if you ask nicely. Alternatively you can simply kill him.

- Castle Maluradek (TotLM):
  The study in the southeastern corner of the upper floor can be used after making the area safe.
