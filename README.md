# Golem Construction for Spellcasters
*A mod for BG:EE - Siege of Dragonspear and BG2:EE that allows spellcasters to build their own golems.*

## Overview
You can encounter a great number of golems of various types throughout the game. They are strong, resistant, and utterly loyal to their master. Unfortunately they are mostly hostile towards you.

This mod makes an attempt to change it. It scatters a number of tomes across Faerûn containing the secret knowledge of how to construct golems. Reading these books allows you to build golems by yourself, provided you have enough experience, and all the required materials at hand. Only characters knowledgeable in the arcane arts are able to understand the complex theories behind the golem construction.

Golems can exist for a virtually unlimited time (with exceptions), or until destroyed. They can travel with the party all over the world and follow the commands of their master unconditionally. 


## Components

#### 1. Golem Construction Ability for Spellcasters (for BG:SoD, BG2:EE and EET)

The main component of the mod. It installs a number of golem building manuals which can be found all over Faerûn. The "Manual of Golem Building" comes in six volumes containing knowledge about building different types of golems. Each tome contains a single charge of powerful magic which provides the user with the "Construct Golem" and "Repair Golem" abilities. After the tome's magic is spent it can still be used as reference about building specific types of golems.

It is rumored that there is another secret set of tomes which contains knowledge about constructing more exotic types of golems.

**Golem types taught by the Manuals of Golem Building:**
- Flesh Golems in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants.
- Clay Golems in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants.
- Stone Golems in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants.
- Iron Golems in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants.
- Mithral Golems in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants.
- Adamantite Golems in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants.

Each golem requires materials for constructing the physical shell, and possibly additional ingredients to implement specific key features of the golem. Creating perfect variant is a feat by itself and requires certain unique artifacts of power for the enchantment process.

The construction of golems takes time and has to be done in specific places of power. In Siege of Dragonspear you can try Sorcerous Sundries, the Repository of Undeath beneath the Dwarven Dig Site and the ruins of Kanaglym which are accessible from the Underground River area. In Shadows of Amn both the Planar Sphere and Jermien's Home in Imnesville may be suitable. The Wizard's Library on the second floor of Watcher's Keep can be used as well. In Throne of Bhaal your Pocket Plane may work, after installing some equipment.
