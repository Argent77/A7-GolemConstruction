Introduction
============

Golems can be constructed with the "Construct Golem" ability which you can learn from the various golem building manuals.
A short dialog allows you to select the desired golem type and variant to build. The construction of the physical 
body takes several hours up to several days, followed by the enchantment process. There is a 4 percent chance that 
the golem may break free and turn on the caster for 1d4 rounds before it finally submits to your will. After the 
construction process finished the caster will be too tired to cast spells or fight properly for several rounds.

Because of the equipment required to successfully construct the golem's body you are limited to a few selected locations 
where you can actually build a golem. Promising locations are usually (abandoned) strongholds of powerful mages.
More details can be found at the end of this document.

The "Construct Golem" ability can be used as many times as needed without the need to rest in between (although it is 
strongly recommended).

Golem manuals will also teach you the "Repair Golem" ability. It can be used once per day in any location, but does 
not work while enemies are around. The repair process takes about two rounds.


Conventional Golems
===================

Conventional golem types are described in the "Manual of Golem Building" which comes in six volumes. The tomes 
themselves are not terribly difficult to obtain. Some can be purchased from merchants while others may be hidden 
in some dungeon or guarded by creatures.

The materials required to build golems are also obtainable from various sources. More common ingredients can be bought 
from merchants, looted from creatures or found in various locations, while the more expensive or exotic materials are 
available by other means.

Conventional golem types can be build in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants. Each variant requires its own 
materials. The perfect variant will also require a specific artifact of power which is only available in limited numbers.

Each golem has the following abilities by default:
1. Dismiss:  Activating this ability will cause the golem to disintegrate. The process is irreversible.
2. Teleport: Teleports itself to a selected party member in visual range. This ability may be needed for golems with 
             big circle sizes so they won't get stuck in narrow pathways. It can only be used while no enemies are 
             around.

You can also give your golems simple commands. Lesser variants of flesh, clay and stone golems, as well as maggot golems 
may follow the following orders:
- Follow me! (The golem becomes controllable, but does not act on its own. This is the default action after activation.)
- Stand guard! (The golem turns neutral and does not budge from its current position.)
- Destroy yourself! (Causes the golem to disintegrate. This command is the same as the "Dismiss" ability, but can also 
                     be issued when the golem is on guard duty.)

More advanced golems may also follow the following orders:
- Follow and protect me! (The golem becomes controllable and will attack any hostile creature in sight, or enemies that 
                          are attacking party members.)
- Stand guard and defend the area! (The golem turns neutral and attacks any hostile creature in sight. Always returns 
                                    to its guarded position.)

You should always take good care of your golems as they may exhibit severe penalties when badly hurt.


Known locations where you can successfully construct golems
===========================================================

Siege of Dragonspear:
- Sorcerous Sundries: You may rent the second floor from the proprietor of the shop.
- Repository of Undeath: This dungeon can be found beneath the Dwarven Dig Site. You have to make the area safe first 
                         by destroying the undead minions and dealing with the current resident.
- Ruins of Kanaglym: The ruins are accessible from the Underground River area. You have to make the area safe first 
                     by destroying all enemies and dealing with Kherriun.

Shadows of Amn:
- Planar Sphere: The opening area of the Sphere may be suitable for golem building (after dealing with the former owner, 
                 of course).
- Jermien's Home: You may be able to convince him to use his home in Imnesville for building your own golems.

Watcher's Keep:
- Second Level: The wizard library is well equipped, but you must disable all defense mechanisms first (which includes 
                the Chromatic Demon).

Throne of Bhaal:
- The Pocket Plane: This place looks safe enough for all kinds of magical experiments. Lazarus Librarus may provide 
                    the required equipment.
