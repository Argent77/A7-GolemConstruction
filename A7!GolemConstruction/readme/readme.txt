Golem Construction for Spellcasters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version:  1.0
Author:   Argent77


Overview
~~~~~~~~

A mod for Siege of Dragonspear and BG2:EE that allows spellcasters to build their own golems.

You can encounter a great number of golems of various types throughout the game. They are strong, 
resistant, and utterly loyal to their master. Unfortunately they are mostly hostile towards you.

This mod makes an attempt to change it. It scatters a number of tomes across Faerûn containing the 
secret knowledge of how to construct golems. Reading these books allows you to build golems by 
yourself, provided you have enough experience, and all the required materials at hand. Only 
characters knowledgeable in the arcane arts are able to understand the complex theories behind the 
golem construction.

Golems can exist for a virtually unlimited time (with exceptions), or until destroyed. They can 
travel with the party all over the world and follow the commands of their master unconditionally. 


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive 
into your game directory and run either "setup-A7!GolemConstruction.exe" (on Windows) or 
"setup-A7!GolemConstruction" (on Mac OS X). 
Follow the instructions and you are ready to start. It is strongly recommend to install the mod 
before starting the "Siege of Dragonspear" campaign (BG:EE), or starting a new game (BG2:EE).

Important: The game must be patched to v2.0 or higher to install this mod.


Components
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Golem Construction Ability for Spellcasters (for BG:SoD, BG2:EE and EET)

The main component of the mod. It installs a number of golem building manuals which can be found 
all over Faerûn. The "Manual of Golem Building" comes in six volumes containing knowledge about 
building different types of golems. Each tome contains a single charge of powerful magic which 
provides the user with the "Construct Golem" and "Repair Golem" abilities. After the tome's magic 
is spent it can still be used as reference about building specific types of golems.

It is rumored that there is another secret set of tomes which contains knowledge about constructing 
more exotic types of golems.

Golem types taught by the Manual of Golem Building:
- Flesh Golems in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants.
- Clay Golems in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants.
- Stone Golems in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants.
- Iron Golems in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants.
- Mithral Golems in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants.
- Adamantite Golems in lesser, regular, greater and perfect variants.

Each golem requires materials for constructing the physical shell, and possibly additional 
ingredients to implement specific key features of the golem. Creating perfect variant is a feat 
by itself and requires certain unique artifacts of power for the enchantment process.

The construction of golems takes time and has to be done in places with the right equipment. 
In Siege of Dragonspear you can try Sorcerous Sundries, the Repository of Undeath beneath the 
Dwarven Dig Site and the ruins of Kanaglym which are accessible from the Underground River. 
In Shadows of Amn the Planar Sphere and Jermien's Home in Imnesville may be suitable. The 
Wizard's Library on the second floor of Watcher's Keep can be used as well. In Throne of Bhaal 
your Pocket Plane may work, after installing some equipment.

Golems may follow simple commands. To change a command simply talk to them (you may have to force 
the talk by pressing the Talk button, or pressing F1).


2. Tweaks (require the main component to be installed)

2.1. Replace original Golem Manual
TODO

2.2. Improve enemy spellcaster AI
This component improves the vanilla AI of mages and priest, so that they will attempt to use more 
effective measures against golems. High level spellcasters have also access to a single HLA which 
is randomly chosen.

2.3. Golems for enemy spellcasters
TODO

2.4. Greater variety of enemy golem types
TODO
